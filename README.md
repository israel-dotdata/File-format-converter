# File Format Converter
## Overview
This project converts CSV files obtained from a MySQL database into JSON format for improved efficiency in downstream data engineering pipelines. JSON is often preferred over CSV due to its flexibility, nested structure support, and compatibility with various applications.

The program reads CSV files according to a schema definition, processes them using **Pandas**, and outputs the equivalent JSON files in a specified target directory.
